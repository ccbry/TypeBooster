I want to tell you a story. No, not the story of how, in 1991, Linus
Torvalds wrote the first version of the Linux kernel. You can read that
story in lots of Linux books. Nor am I going to tell you the story of
how, some years earlier, Richard Stallman began the GNU Project to
create a free Unix-like operating system. That's an important story too,
but most other Linux books have that one, as well.
No, I want to tell you the story of how you take back control of your
computer.
When I began working with computers as a college student in the
late 1970s, there was a revolution going on. The invention of the
microprocessor had made it possible for ordinary people like you and
me to actually own a computer. It's hard for many people today to
imagine what the world was like when only big business and big
government ran all the computers. Let's just say, you couldn't get much
done.
